// Tuples
// Tuples is array of fixed elements already you have idea that how many will be your array elements
// In normal arrays we first define the type and initialize the array
// example let numbers:number[]=[]
// But in tuple me don't define the type outside me define the type inside array
var gender = ["Male", "Female"];
// we defined that we have an array of fixed elements having the length 2
// 1 problem in tuples
//if we use the push method it will accept the element it is underobservation in TS
gender.push("Tiktokers"); // didn't complain
var Admin = [1, "Admin"];
var error = [404, "Not found"];
